description: An Inland Voyage, details his canoeing trip through France and Belgium
  in 1876. Pioneering new ground in outdoor literature, this was Stevenson's first
  book. He had decided to become free from his parent's financial support so that
  he might freely pursue the woman he loved; to support himself he wrote travelogues,
  most notably An Inland Voyage, Travels with a Donkey in the CÃ©vennes and The Silverado
  Squatters. Stevenson undertook the journey with his friend, Sir Walter Grindlay
  Simpson, at a time when such outdoor travel for leisure was considered unusual and
  it resulted in this romantic and original work that still inspires travelers today.
